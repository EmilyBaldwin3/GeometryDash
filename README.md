My Geometry Dash Game is inspired by the classic Geometry Dash Game. 
Press space bar to begin and use the space bar to make the main character ("yellow") jump over the triangles and onto the squares. 
If you land on a triangle, your points are reset to 0. 
If you accrue 5 consecutive points, you win.
HAVE FUN PLAYING!!
